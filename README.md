# ConcurrentWebProxyLogger

## Introduction

The ConcurrentWebProxyLogger is a C-based project that creates an efficient web proxy capable of handling and logging multiple web requests concurrently. It offers a practical approach to understanding concurrency and synchronization in network programming.

## Features

- **Sequential and Concurrent Processing:** The proxy starts with sequential request processing and evolves to handle requests concurrently.
- **Efficient Request Logging:** Logs every request and response, providing insights into the network interactions.
- **Enhanced Learning in Network Programming:** Facilitates a deeper understanding of client-server relationships and network dynamics.
